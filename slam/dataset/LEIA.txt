Desc: Sensor logs recorded on the second floor of the USC SAL building (Raddish source forge)


The files are gzip\\\'ed text files. Each line records the measurements made by a particular sensor at a particular point in time. Fields within lines are space delimited, and have the following format:

Sensor type (\\\"position\\\" or \\\"laser\\\")
Sensor index (0 for this data set)
Data timestamp (time at which the phenomena occurred; Unix time).
Sensor data (specific for each sensor type):
Position: pose_x pose_y pose_theta vel_x vel_y vel_theta
Laser: range bearing intensity range bearing intensity...[repeats]
All units are SI (meters, radians, seconds, etc).
Notes:

The order of the lines in the file reflects the order in which data was recieved from the robot, as a result, the data timestamps may not be in chronological order.
